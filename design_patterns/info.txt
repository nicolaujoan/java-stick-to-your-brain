EXPLANATION:

Filter pattern or Criteria pattern is a design pattern that enables developers to
filter a set of objects using different criteria and chaining them in a decoupled way
through logical operations. This type of design pattern comes under structural
pattern as this pattern combines multiple criteria to obtain single criteria.

IMPLEMENTATION:

We are going to create a Person object, Criteria interface and concrete classes
implementing this interface to filter list of Person objects. CriteriaPatternDemo,
our demo class, uses Criteria objects to filter List of Person objects based on
various criteria and their combinations.
